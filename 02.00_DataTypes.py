# 1. Numbers
# 2. Strings
# 3. List
# 4. Tuple
# 5. Dictionary
# 6. Set
# 7. Boolean



# 1. Numbers (int, float, complex)
# Integers
a = 10
print(a)

# Float
b = 10.5
print(b)

# Complex
c = 10 + 5j
print(c)


# 2. Strings
name = "Python"
print(name)

# 3. List
# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list)

# 4. Tuple
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)

# 5. Dictionary
# Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
my_dict = {
    "name": "Python",
    "version": 3.8
}
print(my_dict)

# 6. Set
# Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)

# 7. Boolean
# Boolean represents True or False
is_true = True
is_false = False
print(is_true)
print(is_false)

# Type Conversion
# int() - converts to integer
# float() - converts to float
# str() - converts to string
# list() - converts to list
# tuple() - converts to tuple
# dict() - converts to dictionary
# set() - converts to set
# bool() - converts to boolean
