# Variables in Python

# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

# Example
x = 5
y = "Hassan"
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
# Example
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Hassan" # x is now of type str
print(x)

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
# Example
x = "Hassan"
# is the same as
x = 'Hassan'
